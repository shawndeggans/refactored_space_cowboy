# Product Requirements Document: Databricks Budget Management System

## Executive Summary
This PRD defines the requirements for a comprehensive budget tracking and management system for the Nova Dynamics Stellar Analytics Division (SAD). The system will enable detailed cost tracking for seven distinct operational categories through programmatic budget creation, enforcement, and monitoring at the account level.

## Product Overview
The Databricks Budget Management System consists of a series of automated notebooks that programmatically implement budget policies, track spending, and generate visualizations for both individual operational categories and overall division expenses.

## User Stories

### As a SAD division leader, I want to:
- View total budget allocation and spending across all operational categories
- Receive automated alerts when budgets reach 75%, 90%, and 100% thresholds
- Generate executive-level visualizations of spending patterns

### As a stellar analyst, I want to:
- Track specific operational category budgets (Deep Space Telemetry, Propulsion Analytics, etc.)
- Understand cost implications of my compute resource usage
- Adhere to enforced budget policies automatically

## Technical Requirements

### System Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **SDK**: Databricks SDK for Python v0.15+
- **Framework**: Databricks Notebooks
- **Storage**: Databricks system tables for usage data

### Tagging Strategy
All resources must implement the following tag hierarchy:

```python
{
    "OperationalCategory": "[DEEP_SPACE_TELEMETRY | PROPULSION_ANALYTICS | ORBITAL_MECHANICS | MATERIALS_SCIENCE | EXPLORATORY_MISSIONS | NAVIGATION_SYSTEMS | EXOPLANET_RESEARCH]",
    "Project": "[SpecificProjectName]",
    "Team": "SAD",
    "Environment": "[DEV | PROD]",
    "CostCenter": "ND-Analytics",
    "Owner": "[UserEmail]"
}
```

### Budget Categories

1. **Deep Space Telemetry**: All deep space communication and data analysis activities
2. **Propulsion Analytics**: Rocket propulsion research and optimization
3. **Orbital Mechanics**: Trajectory planning and orbital dynamics
4. **Materials Science**: Spacecraft materials testing and development
5. **Exploratory Missions**: Unmanned probe mission analytics
6. **Navigation Systems**: Advanced navigation development and testing
7. **Exoplanet Research**: Exoplanetary discovery and analysis

## Implementation Components

### 1. Budget Policy Setup Notebook
**Purpose**: Programmatically create budget policies for each operational category

**Requirements**:
- Create budget policies using Databricks SDK
- Set budget limits: Monthly allocation for each category
- Configure alert thresholds (75%, 90%, 100%)
- Enforce tag-based filtering for budget tracking
- Automate policy enforcement through cluster policies

**Key Functions**:
```python
create_budget_policy(category_name, monthly_limit, tags)
add_budget_alert(policy_id, email_list, threshold_percent)
enforce_tag_compliance(cluster_policy_definition)
```

### 2. Category Budget Monitoring Notebooks (7 total)
**Purpose**: Individual notebooks for tracking each budget category

**Requirements**:
- Real-time cost monitoring for specific operational category
- Usage trend analysis
- Resource utilization breakdowns
- Projected vs actual spending
- Visualizations:
  - Time-series spending
  - Resource type distribution
  - User contribution analysis
  - Budget vs actual comparison

**Key Functions**:
```python
get_category_usage(category_name, date_range)
generate_utilization_dashboard(category_data)
create_spending_forecast(historical_data)
generate_alert_report(budget_threshold_data)
```

### 3. Master Budget Dashboard Notebook
**Purpose**: Overall division budget tracking and executive reporting

**Requirements**:
- Aggregated views across all budget categories
- Total spending analytics
- Comparative analysis between categories
- Executive summary visualizations
- Resource optimization recommendations
- Visualizations:
  - Pie chart of category distribution
  - Stacked bar chart of historical spending
  - Heat map of resource utilization
  - Alert status overview dashboard

**Key Functions**:
```python
aggregate_all_budgets()
generate_executive_summary()
create_comparative_analysis()
generate_optimization_recommendations()
export_leadership_report()
```

### Cluster Management Strategy
Implement automatic cluster policies to enforce budget compliance:

1. **All-Purpose Compute Policy**: Limited to research and exploratory work
2. **Jobs Compute Policy**: Preferred for scheduled workloads
3. **Auto-termination**: Mandatory 30-minute idle timeout
4. **Instance Type Restrictions**: Based on operational category requirements
5. **Maximum Workers**: Limits based on budget category

## Visual Requirements

### Required Visualizations
1. **Time Series Budget Tracking**: Line chart showing actual vs budgeted spending
2. **Resource Utilization**: Bar chart by compute type (jobs vs all-purpose)
3. **Category Breakdown**: Pie chart showing budget allocation by category
4. **User Spending Analysis**: Table with individual contributions to category spending
5. **Alert Status Dashboard**: Visual indicators for budget threshold status
6. **Cost Optimization Opportunities**: Visualization of potential savings

### Visualization Tools
- Matplotlib for static charts
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Databricks native visualization capabilities
- Export capability to PDF/HTML for reporting

## Data Requirements

### Input Data Sources
1. `system.billing.usage` table for cost data
2. `system.billing.billable_usage` for detailed usage metrics
3. Cluster policies configuration
4. Budget policy definitions
5. Tag metadata from compute resources

### Output Data
1. Formatted reports in PDF/HTML
2. Interactive dashboards
3. Alert notifications via email
4. Exported CSV data for external analysis

## Security and Compliance

### Access Control
- Role-based access to budget notebooks
- Read-only access for non-administrators
- Audit logging for all budget modifications

### Data Protection
- Encryption for sensitive budget data
- Secure handling of email distributions
- Retention policy for historical data

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing
- Verify budget policy creation and enforcement
- Test alert generation at thresholds
- Validate tag filtering accuracy
- Confirm visualization generation

### Performance Testing
- Query optimization for large datasets
- Dashboard loading times
- Alert delivery latency

## Success Criteria
1. Accurate tracking of spending by operational category
2. Automated enforcement of budget policies
3. < 1 hour delay in cost reporting
4. 100% tag compliance for new resources
5. Successful alert delivery at threshold points
6. Comprehensive visualization of budget data

## Notebook Specifications
